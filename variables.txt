A variable:
===========
A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

we have 3 keywords in javascript
1.var
2.let
3.const

The Difference Between 'var' and 'let':
-----------------------------------------

*The main difference between var and let is that the scope of the variable that is defined by let is limited to the block
        in which it is declared, whereas the variable declared using var has the global scope,
           		i.e., can be used throughout the code.

declaration:
----------

let message;

Assigning:
-----------
message="hello";

Initilization:
------------

var message="good morning";

*We can also declare multiple variables in one line: not recomnded

let user = 'sathya', age = 25, message = 'Hello';


recomnded to write variables:
---------------------

let user = 'sathya';
let age = 25;
let message = 'Hello';


In older scripts, you may also find another keyword: var instead of let:
-----------------
var message = 'Hello';
The var keyword is almost the same as let. It also declares a variable, 
but in a slightly different, “old-school” way.

There are subtle differences between let and var, but they do not matter for us yet.


Variable naming:
-----------------
There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:

The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
The first character must not be a digit.
Examples of valid names:

let userName;
let test123;

When the name contains multiple words, camelCase is commonly used.
 That is: words go one after another, each word except first starting with a capital letter: myVeryLongName.

What’s interesting – the dollar sign '$' and the underscore '_' can also be used in names. They are regular symbols, just like letters, without any special meaning.

These names are valid:
---------------------

let $ = 1; // declared a variable with the name "$"
let _ = 2; // and now a variable with the name "_"

alert($ + _); // 3
Examples of incorrect variable names:
-------------------------------------

let 1a; // cannot start with a digit

let my-name; // hyphens '-' aren't allowed in the name


Constants:
-----------
To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use const instead of let:

const myBirthday = '04.06.1994';
Variables declared using const are called “constants”. They cannot be reassigned. An attempt to do so would cause an error:

const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';

myBirthday = '01.01.2001'; // error, can't reassign the constant!


----->
We can declare variables to store data by using the var, let, or const keywords.

let: – is a modern variable declaration.
var :– is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don’t use it at all, but we’ll cover subtle differences from let in the chapter The old "var", just in case you need them.
const: – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed
